## Dunder Methods
__doulbe underscores__ is the format, dunder methods are predefined methods that let you emulate the behavior of built-in
types. through dunder we can do the following:

- Initialization of new objects: e.g.```__init__```
- Object representation: e.g.```__str__```
- Enable iteration: e.g.```__len__```
- Operator overloading (comparison): e.g.```dir()```builtin with a bunch of dunders e.g. ```__eq__```
- Operator overloading (addition): e.g.```__add__```
- Method invocation: e.g.```__call__```
- Context manager support (with statement): e.g.```__enter__```

Dunder methods often come with the ```self``` as their default params

## Python Iterators

>"Objects that support the __iter__ and __next__ dunder methods automatically work with for-in loops."
> 
> 
for-in loops format:
```angular2html
repeater = Repeater('Hello')
for item in repeater:
    print(item)
```

## Python Generators

this allows you to write concise for-in loops. in generators, functions do not use return statements, instead, they use
```yield```  to pass data back to the caller.

Through generators, we can short this seven lines of code:
```angular2html
class Repeater:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        return self.value
```
to 2 lines of beauty code: (generators format)
```angular2html
def repeater(value):
    while True:
        yield value

```
