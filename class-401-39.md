### context

React context allows us to share data (state) across our components more easily.
The following data can be passed:

- Theme data (like dark or light mode)
- User data (the currently authenticated user)
- Location-specific data (like user language or locale)

React context helps us avoid the problem of props drilling.

**Props drilling** is a term to describe when you pass props down multiple levels to a nested component, through components that don't need it.

Use React context

- Create context using the createContext method.
- Take your created context and wrap the context provider around your component tree.
- Put any value you like on your context provider using the value prop.
- Read that value within any component by using the context consumer.

### useContext hook
makes our components more concise and allows us to create our own custom hooks.
