##Readings: Passing Functions as Props

### React Docs - lists and keys

- What does .map() return?
  
 ```map() method allows you to loop over every element in an array and modify or add to it and then return a different element to take that elements place```

- If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?
  ```html
  use map() methods and JSX rendering. simple code from stackoverflow.
  {array.map((el) => (
    <React.Fragment key={}>
        {this.function(el)}
        <p>text</p>
    </React.Fragment>))}```

  
- Each list item needs a unique ____.
  ```id```

- What is the purpose of a key?
```
Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. 
Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity:
```

### The Spread Operator

- What is the spread operator?

```
The spread operator is a new addition to the set of operators in JavaScript ES6. It takes in an iterable (e.g an array) and expands it into individual elements.
```
- List 4 things that the spread operator can do.

>Using Math functions.
>Using an array as arguments.
>Adding an item to a list.
>Adding to state in React.
>Combining objects.
>Converting NodeList to an array.

- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

```html
const numbersOne = [1, 2, 3];
const numbersTwo = [4, 5, 6];
const numbersCombined = [...numbersOne, ...numbersTwo];

Output [1,2,3,4,5,6]
```

- Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

```html

```
- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

```html
const myVehicle = {
  brand: 'Ford',
  model: 'Mustang',
  color: 'red'
}

const updateMyVehicle = {
  type: 'car',
  year: 2021, 
  color: 'yellow'
}

const myUpdatedVehicle = {...myVehicle, ...updateMyVehicle}

Output: {
    "brand": "Ford",
    "model": "Mustang",
    "color": "yellow",
    "type": "car",
    "year": 2021
}
```

### How to Pass Functions Between Components

- In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?

```
create an increment function
```
- In your own words, what does the increment function do?


```
It takes a variable and increments (changes) its value, and also returns this value. 
```
- How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?


```
A parent component defines a function.
The function is passed as a prop to a child component.
The child component then invokes the prop.
The parent function is then called, usually changing something.
Then the parent component is re-rendered along with its children.
```
- How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?


```
using references which is supported on class components and recently on functional components using hooks.
```

- takeways:

You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces {}
