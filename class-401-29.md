## Django Best Practices: Custom User Model

In real world most likely we will have to create customized user models instead of use th Django's built-in models.

### set up

- set virtual environment venv.
- Install Django
- make a Django project
- create an Django app
- test runserver


### Custom user model

- update settings.py
- create a ```CustomUser``` model
- create new ```UserCreation``` and ```UserChangeForm```
- update the admin

### Create superuser
used to log in/out admin.

### Templates/Views/URLs

- updating settings.py to create a project-level templates directory. 
- create .html in templates folder
- url.py: creates paths.
- test server

### read source code of DjangoX project.

###  substitute a custom user model
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/auth/customizing/#auth-custom-user

Things I want to know more:
- Just curious, Youtube is Django built-up, how its user model looks like? and how can I locate its source code?
