Headings h

HTML has six "levels" of headings:
h1 is used for main headings
h2 is used for subheadings
If there are further sections under the subheadings then the
h3 element is used, and soon...

Paragraphs p
  
To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the
paragraph with an opening <p> tag and closing </p> tag.  

bold and italic
  .
<b>
By enclosing words in the tags
<b> and </b> we can make
characters appear bold.
The <b> element also represents a section of text that would be
presented in a visually different
way (for example key words in a
paragraph) although the use of
the <b> element does not imply
any additional m
  
By enclosing words in the tags
<i> and </i> we can make
characters appear italic.
The <i> element also represents
a section of text that would be
said in a different way from
surrounding content â€” such as
technical terms, names of ships,
foreign words, thoughts, or other
terms that would usually be
italicized.
  
  <sup>
The <sup> element is used
to contain characters that
should be superscript such
as the suffixes of dates or
mathematical concepts like
raising a number to a power such
as 22
.
<sub>
The <sub> element is used to
contain characters that should
be subscript. It is commonly
used with foot notes or chemical
formulas such as H20.

Strong & Emphasis

Abbreviations & Acronyms
  
HTML elements are used to describe the structure of
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
X They also provide semantic information (e.g. where
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation)
  
A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

  Functions allow you to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task.
Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required
to do their job) and may return a value.
An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.
In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.
Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window.
JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).
  
  A script is made up of a series of statements. Each
statement is like a step in a recipe.
Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
you might specify that a value must be remembered
before creating a calculation using that value.
Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script.
Arrays are special types of variables that store more
than one piece of related information.
JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
Expressions evaluate into a single value.
Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
