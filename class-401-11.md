## JupyterLAb

- JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter.

- JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.
- Code Consoles provide transient scratchpads for running code interactively, with full support for rich output. A code console can be linked to a notebook kernel as a computation log from the notebook, for example.

- Kernel-backed documents enable code in any text file (Markdown, Python, R, LaTeX, etc.) to be run interactively in any Jupyter kernel.

- Notebook cell outputs can be mirrored into their own tab, side by side with the notebook, enabling simple dashboards with interactive controls backed by a kernel.

- Multiple views of documents with different editors or viewers enable live editing of documents reflected in other viewers. For example, it is easy to have live preview of Markdown, Delimiter-separated Values, or Vega/Vega-Lite documents.
- JupyterLab also offers a unified model for viewing and handling data formats. JupyterLab understands many file formats (images, CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF, Vega, Vega-Lite, etc.) 
- It can also display rich kernel output in these formats. See File and Output Formats for more information.

## NumPy

- NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package. 

### Creating A NumPy Array
```angular2html
# by import files

import csv
with open("winequality-red.csv", 'r') as f:
    wines = list(csv.reader(f, delimiter=";"))
import numpy as np
wines = np.array(wines[1:], dtype=np.float)
```
```angular2html
import numpy as np
empty_array = np.zeros((3,4))
empty_array
```
### Using NumPy To Read In Files
```angular2html
wines = np.genfromtxt("winequality-red.csv", delimiter=";", skip_header=1)
```

### Slicing NumPy Arrays
using a colon (:). A colon indicates that we want to select all the elements from the starting index up to but not including the ending index.
```angular2html
wines[:3,3]
array([ 1.9, 2.6, 2.3])
```
### N-Dimensional NumPy Arrays

```angular2html
earnings = [
    [
        [500,505,490],
        [810,450,678],
        [234,897,430],
        [560,1023,640]
    ],
    [
        [600,605,490],
        [345,900,1000],
        [780,730,710],
        [670,540,324]
    ]
]
```

### NumPy Array Operations
ny of the basic mathematical operations (/, *, -, +, ^) with an array and a value, 
it will apply the operation to each of the elements in the array.
