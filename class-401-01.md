## Pain vs. Suffering

- Pain means growth.

- Suffering is pain without purpose. Pain with no higher goal. Pain with no dreams, no ambition, no aspiration.

## Big O notation

```O(1)``` describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set

```O(N)``` describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.

```O(NÂ²)``` represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.

```O(2^N)``` denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. The growth curve of an O(2^N) function is exponential

##  Facts and Myths about Python names and values

1. Assignment never copies data.
2. Python is neither "Call By value" nor "Call By Reference", it's "Call by Assignment"! Epic! 
3. There is no way in python where a name can refer to another name. A name can only refer to values.
