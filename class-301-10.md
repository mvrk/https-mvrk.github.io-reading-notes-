The JavaScript engine (which is found in a hosting environment like the browser), 
is a single-threaded interpreter comprising of a heap and a single call stack. 
The browser provides web APIs like the DOM, AJAX, and Timers.


### Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

- What is a ‘call’?

```
a function invocation (call)
a function() execution
```

- How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

```
one at a time, from top to bottom
```

- What does LIFO mean?


```
Last In, First Out (LIFO) 
```

- Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.


```

```

- What causes a Stack Overflow?


```
The stack overflow error is often caused by an infinite loop or the creation of variables larger than the size of the call stack.
