## Readings: In memory storage
The JavaScript engine (which is found in a hosting environment like the browser), 
is a single-threaded interpreter comprising of a heap and a single call stack. 
The browser provides web APIs like the DOM, AJAX, and Timers.


### Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

- What is a ‘call’?

```
a function invocation (call)
a function() execution
```

- How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

```
one at a time, from top to bottom
```

- What does LIFO mean?


```
Last In, First Out (LIFO) 
```

- Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.


```

```

- What causes a Stack Overflow?

```
The stack overflow error is often caused by an infinite loop or the creation of variables larger than the size of the call stack.
```

### JavaScript error messages

- What is a ‘reference error’?

```
This is as simple as when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.
```

- What is a ‘syntax error’?

```
when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax
```

- What is a ‘range error’?

```
Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of errors will show up
```

- What is a ‘tyep error’?

```
the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, 
Flike accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.
```

- What is a breakpoint?

```
breakpoint, which will make your program stop at that point only if a condition is met.
```

- What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?

```
The debugger keyword is used in the code to force stop the execution of the code at a breaking point and calls the debugging function.
```
