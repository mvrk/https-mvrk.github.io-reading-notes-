# Docker

Docker is a linux container which are a type of virtualization. with docker, the entire development environment is 
isolated: programming language, software packages, databases.

**pros and cons**
- isolated environment can be reproduced easily and can be shared among team members.
- complexity under the hood may not good to be mess with.

## Containers vs Virtual Environments

- Virtual env use to only isolate software packages locally
- Docker is OS level virtualization

## Docker in a glance

- install docker  ```pip install docker-compose```
- images and containers
  - image is a snapshot in time of what a project contains
  - a container is a running instance of the image
  - images build ```docker image build .```
- Dockerized Django: create a  Dockerfile for the image can replace Django local dev env.


# Django REST Framework

Django REST Framework works alongside the Django web framework to create web APIs.

## traditional Django vs Django REST Framework
- Traditional Django is what we learned last week, a single project with multi apps represent different functionalities.
- Django creates websites containing webpages. 
- Django REST Framework creates web APIs which are a collection of URL endpoints containing available HTTP verbs that return JSON.

## Django REST Framework
- install ```pip install djangorestframework```
- update settings.py 'rest_framework'
- create a new URL route, a new view, and a new serializer file
- A serializer is a Json, response for translating complex data request into an easy-to-consume type.
- Browsable API: REST built-in to display both content and HTTP verbs.
- tests: REST provides additional helper classes besides the Django built-in unittest module.
- Deployment: the already learned Heroku.
