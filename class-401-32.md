- ***Throttling*** is similar to permissions, in that it determines if a request should be authorized. 
Throttles indicate a temporary state, and are used to control the rate of requests that clients can make to an API.

- ***Authentication*** is the mechanism of associating an incoming request with a set of identifying credentials, 
such as the user the request came from, or the token that it was signed with. 

- ***Permission*** checks are always run at the very start of the view, before any other code is allowed to proceed. 
Permission checks will typically use the ***authentication*** information

- Permission in REST Framework ary defined as a list of permission class.

- REST Framework support object-level permission, it used to determine if a user should be allowed to act on a
particular object. normally a model instance.
