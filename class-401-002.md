“Pretend your time is worth $1,000/hr. 
Would you spend five of them doing extra work for free? 
Would you waste one on being angry?”

```angular2html
“People are unhappy in large part because they are confused about what is valuable.”

-William Irvine
```
```angular2html
Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. 
If you’re chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something wrong. 
Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. 
Then when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day.”

-Car Newport

but yes to a few things.

```angular2html
Demonstrating computational thinking or the ability to break down large, complex problems 
is just as valuable (if not more so) than the baseline technical skills required for a job.”

```
- Understand: Know exactly what is being asked. 
- Plan: Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.
- Divide: break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.
- Stuck?: Debug, reassess, research and caveat.
- Practice: Practice. Practice. Practice.

### How to Solve Programming Problems
https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/
#### Common mistakes
- improper allocation of time.
-trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration. 

#### Right track
- Read the problem completely twice.
- Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
- Optimize the manual steps.
- Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
- Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
- Optimize the real code.
- As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.

### The 5 Whys
#### Assemble a team, Define the problem and then ask the 5 Whys:
- why the problem is occurring
- ask why 4 more times

### The Super Mario Effect

```
Super Mario Effect: focusing on the princess and not the pits to stick with a task 
and to learn more. This caused me to reflect and realize that there were lots of other
examples from my own personal experience where this attitude of life gamification, 
this Super Mario Effect led to more success and therefore more learning.
