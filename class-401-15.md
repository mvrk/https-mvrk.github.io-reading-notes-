## Trees

### Types
- Binary Trees, 
- Binary Search Trees
- K-ary Trees.

### Terminology

- Node - A Tree node includes its own values and the references to other nodes
- Root - the beginning node of the tree
- K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. 
- Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
- Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
- Edge - The link between a parent and child node
- Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
- Height - The number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

### Traversal
- Depth First (DFS)
- Breadth First (BFS)

### Binary tree vs k-ary trees vs binary search tree

- binary tree: a tree in which each node can have at most two
children. Typically the first node is known as the parent and the child
nodes are called left and right.
- A binary search tree:ma binary tree in which the nodes are assigned
values, with the following restrictions:
  - No duplicate values
  - Left child node is smaller than its parent Node
  - Right child node is greater than its parent Node
- K-ary tree: A rooted tree with each node has no more than m children. a general binary tree with K = 2
