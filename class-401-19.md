## Automation - Regex

### Regular Expression
short for Regex, are used to check if a pattern exists in a give string. 
classical regex use are internet search engines and file system finders.

- Regex in Python: ```import re``` and you can use it.
- Basic patterns: use ```re.match(pattern, sequence)``` to match two parameters.

### wild card characters

- ```re.search().group()```
```angular2html
# ********group() method useage************
statement = 'support@datacamp.com'
match = re.search(r'([\w\.-]+)@([\w\.-]+)', statement)
if statement:
  print("Email address:", match.group()) # return Email address: support@datacamp.com
  print("Username:", match.group(1)) # return Username: support
  print("Host:", match.group(2)) # return Host: datacamp.com
```
- ```.``` the period: match any char.
- ```^``` the caret: match the start of string
- ```$``` match the end of the string.
- ```[abc]```: match a or b or c.
- ```[a-zA-Z0-9]``` match any letter or number.
- ```\ ```:
- -[x] escape character
- -[x] ordinary character
- -[x] in front of metachar to remove their special meaning
- ```\w```: match any single letter, digit, underscore
- ```\W```: match any character not part of```\w```.
- ```\s```: match single whitespace: space, newline, tab, return
- ```\S```: match any char not par of ```\s```.
- ```\d```: Lowercase d. Matches decimal digit 0-9.
- ```\D```: Uppercase d. Matches any character that is not a decimal digit.
- ```\t```: Lowercase t. Matches tab.
- ```\n``` : Lowercase n. Matches newline.
- ```\r``` : Lowercase r. Matches return.
- ```\A``` : Uppercase a. Matches only at the start of the string. Works across multiple lines as well.
- ```\Z```: Uppercase z. Matches only at the end of the string.

### Repetitions

- ```+```: check if preceding char appears one or more time start frm that position.
- ```*```: check if preceding char appears zero or more time start frm that position.
- ```?```: check if preceding char appears zero or one time start frm that position.
- ```{x}```: Repeat exactly x number of times.
- ```{x,}```: Repeat at least x times or more.
- ```{x, y}```: Repeat at least x times but no more than y times.
- ```()```: Creates a group when performing matches.
- ```<>```: Creates a named group when performing matches.

### search(), match() and findall()
- match() function checks for a match only at the beginning of the string (by default), 
- search() function checks for a match anywhere in the string.
- findall() Finds all the possible matches in the entire sequence and returns them as a list of strings.
- sub(): sbustitute fucntion
- split(): split matched and return a list.

### Compliation flag
- IGNORECASE (I) - Allows case-insensitive matches.
- DOTALL (S) - Allows . to match any character, including newline.
- MULTILINE (M) - Allows start of string (^) and end of string ($) anchor to match newlines as well.
- VERBOSE (X) - Allows you to write whitespace and comments within a regular expression to make it more readable.

## shutil - High-level File Operations

- **copyfile()** copies the contents of the source to the destination and raises IOError 
if it does not have permission to write to the destination file.
- **copy()** function interprets the output name similar to the commandline ```cp```
- **copy2()** similar to copy() but have more details including access and modifying time.
- **copystat()** copy meta data
- other shutil methods:
```angular2html
copyfile()
copyfileobj()
copymode()
copystat()
copytree()
copytree_verbose()
disk_usage()
get_archive_formats()
get_unpack_formats()
make_archive()
move()
rmtree()
unpack_archive()
which()
which_regular_file()
```

### Things I want to know more:
- Regex implementation
- implementation of shutil to precess files from local file systems.
