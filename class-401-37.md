## React

### React - Hello World
```angular2html
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<h1>Hello, world!</h1>);
```

### React - JSX
- JSX, JavaScript extension, a template language with full power of JS.
- JSX allow you work with UI in JS code.
- Sample JSX code from DOC.
```angular2html
const name = 'Josh Perez';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
```


### React - Rendering Elements
- React elements are objects that easy to create.
- React DOM dynamically updates contents necessarily.

### React - Components & Props
- React components are JS functions
- props: properties. arguments that passed into components called props.
- sample React components from DOC
```angular2html
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

### React - State & Lifecycle
**State**
- State is used with React Component Classes to make them dynamic. 
- It enables the component to keep track of changing information in between renders. 
- the state of a component is an object that holds information that may change over the lifetime of the component.

**Lifecycle**

- theyâ€™re created (mounted on the DOM), 
- they experience growth (by updating), 
- and they die (unmounted from the DOM). 

This is the component lifecycle!

### React - Handling Events
- React events are named using camelCase
- With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
