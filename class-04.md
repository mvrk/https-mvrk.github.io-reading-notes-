```html
<a>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>

Links are created using the A
element which has an attribute
called href. The value of the
href attribute is the page that
you want people to go to when
they click on the link.

>Linking to Other Sites

>Linking to Other Article Pages on the Same Site

>Linking to a Specific Part of the Same Page

Summary

#### Links are created using the a element.

#### The a element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.

#### If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.

#### You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.

#### You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

## LAYOUT
<br>
<br>

>Block-level elements
start on a new line
Examples include:
```HTML
<h1> <p> <ul> <li>
  ```

>Inline elements
flow in between
surrounding text
Examples include:

```HTML
<img> <b> <i>
```

#### Normal FLOW, position:static

#### Relative Positioning, position:relative

#### Absolute Positioning, position:absolute

#### Fixed Positioning, position:fixed

#### Overlapping elements

#### floating element

#### screen size, screen resolution, page sizes,

<br>

>lements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.

>Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

>The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

>Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

>Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

>Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

>CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.

>You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

Functions, Methods and Objects
<br>
<br>
>Functions consist of a
series of statements
that have been grouped
together because they
perform a specific task.

>A method is the same as a
function, except methods
are created inside (and are
part of) an object.

>programmers use objects
to create models of the
worl d using data, and that
objects are made up of
properties and methods.
In this secti on, you learn
how to create your own
objects using JavaScript.

<br>How does pair programming work?
```html
While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
```
<br>Why pair program?
```html
Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary
Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea
Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey
Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful, well structured solution
```
