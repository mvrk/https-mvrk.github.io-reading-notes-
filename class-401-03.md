## Readings: FileIO & Exceptions

### Reading and Writing Files in Python

#### What is a file?
- At its core, a file is a contiguous set of bytes used to store data. 
- Header: metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)
- Data: contents of the file as written by the creator or editor
- End of file (EOF): special character that indicates the end of the file

#### File paths

- Folder Path: the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash / (Unix) or backslash \ (Windows)
- File Name: the actual name of the file
- Extension: the end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) used to indicate the file type

```angular2html
The double-dot (..) can be chained together to traverse multiple directories above 
the current directory. For example,to access animals.csv from the to folder, 
you would use ../../animals.csv.
```

#### Line endings
- This can make iterating over each line problematic, and you may need to account for situations like this.
#### Character encodings
- It’s important to note that parsing a file with the incorrect character encoding 
can lead to failures or misrepresentation of the character. 

### Opening and Closing a File in Python
```angular2html
file = open('dog_breeds.txt')
```

```angular2html
reader = open('dog_breeds.txt')
try:
    # Further file processing goes here
finally:
    reader.close()
```

### "__file__"
- “the pathname of the file from which the module was loaded, if it was loaded from a file.”

## Python Exceptions: An Introduction

### Exceptions versus Syntax Errors
- Syntax errors occur when the parser detects an incorrect statement.
- Exception error occurs whenever syntactically correct Python code results in an error. 

### The AssertionError Exception

- Instead of waiting for a program to crash midway, you can also start by making an assertion in Python.

### The try and except Block: Handling Exceptions
- The try and except block in Python is used to catch and handle exceptions.
```angular2html
try:
    with open('file.log') as file:
        read_data = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError as fnf_error:
    print(fnf_error)
```

### The else Clause
- using the else statement, you can instruct a program to execute a certain block of code only in the absence of exceptions

### Cleaning Up After Using finally
- Imagine that you always had to implement some sort of action to clean up after executing your code

### Summary
>raise allows you to throw an exception at any time.
> 
>assert enables you to verify if a certain condition is met and throw an exception if it isn’t.
> 
>In the try clause, all statements are executed until an exception is encountered.
> 
>except is used to catch and handle the exception(s) that are encountered in the try clause.
> 
>else lets you code sections that should run only when no exceptions are encountered in the try clause.
> 
>finally enables you to execute sections of code that should always run, with or without any previously encountered exceptions.
