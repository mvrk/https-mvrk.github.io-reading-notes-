## Readings: NODE.JS


- What is node.js?

```
- Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.
```

- In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

```
It's a platform that JavaScript can run and excute.
```

- What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

```
The Node. js runtime is the software stack responsible for installing your web service's code and its dependencies and running your service.
```

- What is npm?

```
npm is two things: first and foremost, it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node. js projects; 
second, it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management. 
A plethora of Node.
```

- What version of node are you running on your machine?

```
v18.3.0
```

- What version of npm are you running on your machine?

```
8.11.0
```

- What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

```
npm install
```

- What is node used for?

```
Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser. 
Node can, therefore, be used to write server-side applications with access to the operating system, file system, 
and everything else required to build fully-functional applications.

- How does pair programming work?

```
Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. 
The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. 
Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. 
The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. 
The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. 
The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
