### Readings: Authentication

- What is OAuth?
enables an end user's account information to be used by third-party services, such as Facebook and Google, without exposing the user's account credentials to the third party.


- Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.
Such as use google account to  log in to mongoDB.
  
- How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?
OAuth doesn't share password data but instead uses authorization tokens to prove an identity between consumers and service providers. OAuth is an authentication protocol that allows you to approve one application interacting with another on your behalf without giving away your password.

- What is OpenID?
openID allows you to use an existing account to sign in to multiple websites, without needing to create new passwords.


- What is the difference between authorization and authentication?
Authentication and authorization are two vital information security processes that administrators use to protect systems and information. 
Authentication verifies the identity of a user or service, and authorization determines their access rights.

- What is Authorization Code Flow?
The authorization code flow returns an authorization code to the Relying Party, which can then directly exchange it for an ID token and access token. 
This mechanism provides the benefit of not exposing any tokens to the browser or end-user.

- What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?
The Authorization Code Flow + PKCE is an OpenId Connect flow specifically designed to authenticate native or mobile application users. 
  This flow is considered best practice when using Single Page Apps (SPA) or Mobile Apps. PKCE, pronounced “pixy” is an acronym for Proof Key for Code Exchange.


- What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?
Implicit Flow with Form Post flow uses OIDC to implement web sign-in that is very similar to the way SAML and WS-Federation operates. The web app requests and obtains tokens through the front channel, without the need for secrets or extra backend calls.

- What is Client Credentials Flow?
In the client credentials flow, permissions are granted directly to the application itself by an administrator. 
When the app presents a token to a resource, the resource enforces that the app itself has authorization to perform an action since there is no user involved in the authentication.

- What is Device Authorization Flow?
With input-constrained devices that connect to the internet, rather than authenticate the user directly, 
the device asks the user to go to a link on their computer or smartphone and authorize the device. 
This avoids a poor user experience for devices that do not have an easy way to enter text.

- What is Resource Owner Password Flow?
The Resource Owner Password Credentials flow allows exchanging the username and password of a user for an access token and, optionally, 
a refresh token. This flow has significantly different security properties than the other OAuth flows.
