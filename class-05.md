##### SUMMARY

>Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps
convey the mood and evokes reactions.

>There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.

>Color pickers can help you find the color you want.

>It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).

>CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

>CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

## JPEG VS PNG VS GIF

* TL;DR too long did't read.

>Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth. 

>Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. 

>Use GIF format for images that contain animations.
