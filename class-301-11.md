- Give a real world example.
class student score grade DB

- What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
unstructured data

- Give a real world example.
Document info DB

- Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
SQL

- Which type of database is best for scalability?
NoSQL

- What does SQL stand for?
Standard Query Language

- What is a relational database?
A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

- What type of structure does a relational database work with?
Structured data

- What is a ‘schema’?
 database schema is considered the “blueprint” of a database which describes how the data may relate to other tables or other data models.

- What is a NoSQL database?

NoSQL, also referred to as “not only SQL”, “non-SQL”, is an approach to database design that enables the storage and querying of data outside the traditional structures found in relational databases.

- How does it work?

NoSQL databases store data in documents rather than relational tables. Accordingly, 
we classify them as "not only SQL" and subdivide them by a variety of flexible data models. 
Types of NoSQL databases include pure document databases, key-value stores, wide-column databases, and graph databases.

- What is inside of a Mongo database?

MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. 
A database stores one or more collections of documents.

- Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
In MongoDB, all individual records are stored as documents which are collections of fields with a dynamic schema. 
Here, each collection need not have the same set of fields which makes it more flexible than RDBMS.

- MongoDB disadvantages?

NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID).
