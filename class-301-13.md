### Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API 

Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

```

In its base form, CRUD is a way of manipulating information, describing the function of an application. 
REST is controlling data through HTTP commands. It is a way of creating, modifying, 
and deleting information for the user. CRUD functions can exist in a REST API, 
but REST APIs are not limited to CRUD functions.
```
